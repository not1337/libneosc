#libneosc
An easy access library to the YubiKey NEO(-N)

The library is complete with regards to HID (USB) access as well
as CCID access to the NEO, NDEF and OATH applets.

The OpenPGP anv PIV applet code is a stub only. It will be enhanced
as I do find time and have requirements.

For the API see libneosc.h - the library is very simple to use.

The patches directory contains patches for other packages you might
find useful.
