A series of optional patches for other open source software you may
find useful.

gnupg-2.0.27-pkcs11_reader_match.patch

	Allows for strncmp() like substring reader match.
	Submitted upstream.

gnupg-2.0.27-scd_shared.patch

	Changes exclusive reader access to shared reader access and lock.
	You must not use gpg-agent when using this patch as gpg-agent
	will keep scdaemon running all the time which still breaks
	shared device usage.
	Look e.g. into 'kwalletcli' for a way to keep your sanity
	when it comes to gpg pin entry.

opensc-0.14.0-allowed_readers.patch

	Add an 'allowed_readers' option (same styles as the already
	existing 'ignored_readers') to opensc-pkcs11.so.
	Submitted upstream.

openssh-6.8p1-key_select.patch

	Enable key selection in the style of <key-number>@<provider>
	for openssh. Note that this patch is authored by somebody
	else (see comment at top of patch file).
	For the Yubikey piv applet, key-numbers are:

	9A	01@	(tested)
	9C	02@	(guess)
	9D	03@	(tested)
	9E	04@	(guess)
